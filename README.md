This program is a demonstration of a method which tranforms picture
data into tabular data representing the height of water in an 
experimental wave tank. An animation was added for demonstration
purposes, showing the result of the algorithm against (nearly) raw 
pictures. As written, the unzipped accompanying data folder 'June26j'
must be in the same directory as the .py file in order to run.
